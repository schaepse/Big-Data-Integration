### Understanding Our Topic
### Describe The Tools Used
### Data Sources
The data that we wanted to evaluate for this project came from two sources. The first source was from [84.51's website](https://www.8451.com/). The folder of data that we used from 84.51 are called the Carbo Loading datasets. There are a total of four datasets within this folder. The four datasets are called the casual_lookup, product_lookup, store_lookup, and transactions. According to the Carbo Loading guide provided, these datasets came from a relational database. Also, these datasets contain purchases at a household level over two years, and the datasets are filtered to only contain products from four categories. These four categories are pasta, pasta sauce, syrup, and pancake mix. In addition, the guide contained information pertaining to the variables within each of the datasets. The tables below show these variables.
